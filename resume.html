					<h3>Senior Project</h3>
                    <p id="pattern">Worked on a project for our client Dr. Middleton called <a href='http://musicalgorithms.org'>Music Algorithms</a>.
                    In the project as a team we for the first quarter spent learning the code base and fixing bugs that our client had a list of and
                    bugs that came up after fixing other bugs. During our break the team lead(Issac) and I talked about reworking the backend. After a
                    week of planning and making sure we had all the details we got approval from our client to go ahead and rework it. The second quarter was spent
                    implementing features that were lost in previous iterations of the project. I focused on implementing the biology object which consisted of
                    DNA, RNA, and proteins. I had to implement new additions to the GUI and implement the right conversions as well as fix bugs that popped up 
                    during implementation. In the end, the client was quiet pleased with what work we got accomplished as well as how we left it for the next team(s)
                    that will be picking up in the future.</p>
