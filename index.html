  <h2>Major: Computer Information Systems </h2>

  <p>I decided to do this major because I love to work with computers and at first I was skeptical as to if I would like to program. However, after my first few classes in programming I fell in love with it. This major is focused on creating software/programs. Some examples would be things like minesweeper, hero vs monsters game, or a maze game which uses databases and what not to store information.</p>

   <h2>Minor: Web programming</h2>

  <p>I decided to presue my minor in web programming because I enjoy the web design aspect as well. The business aspect was a recommendation from my advisor and I found out that I actually enjoy that as well. So by doing all three I get exactly what I enjoy doing.</p>

  <h2>Background</h2>

  <p>I am currently a senior at Eastern Washington University(E.W.U) in the Computer Information Systems major with a minor in web programming and focus in business management. I started at E.W.U. in the fall of 2010 and am planning on graduating in the winter of 2016. During my first year at E.W.U. I worked for the Mars Lab which assisted students with design work using the adobe software. Also, I assisted in printing posters out as well as troubleshooting issues students had with printing or doing course work with the adobe products.</p>

  <p>Before going to E.W.U., I attended Walla Walla Community College from 2007 to 2010 and graduated with a degree in Informatics of Networking. While going to school I worked with the IT department in helping troubleshoot issues instructors had, setting up labs with imaging software and other miscellaneous tasks.</p>
